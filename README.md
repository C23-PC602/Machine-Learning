# Machine-Learning

**Image Classification Using CNN**

Create a machine learning model that can classify the maturity level of coffee fruit (Raw, half-ripe and ripe) using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.

**Installation / Software Requirements**

Using Google Colab notebook to train Image Classification model.
No software installation was required for this project. 
A Gmail account is required to access Google Colaboratory.

* import tensorflow
* import keras
* import numpy
* import pandas

**Preprocessing**

Resized all images to 224 by 224 pixels and created two sets i.e train set and val set. Train set contains 840 images and val set contains 210 images.

**Classification of maturity coffee fruits**

1.	Upload dataset to your drive
2.	Open code “DCoffee_Classification.ipynb” in google collab
3.	Run all cell and then you will get the classification of coffee fruit maturity
